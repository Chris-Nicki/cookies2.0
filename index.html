            ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed 
            throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 
            about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes 
            before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
